MIPS is Active

MIPS is a tool created for a devised, site-specific, improvisational, interactive theatre piece at University of San Diego.

In the piece, the audience has been invited to witness the demo at the end of a laborious research project into a technological tracking device, MIPS.  The audience is told that the test-subjects for the demo (all actors) have MIPS installed on their phones and the demo will consist of each of the test-subjects retracing the steps of another test-subject using the data that MIPS collected from them.  Each actor led a group of audience members on their test-subjects route, retracing the steps according to the clues delivered by MIPS to their phone with the audience following along both physically and on their own devices.

MIPS, through the actors' machinations, provided clues and hints in the form of geodata, images, audio recordings, and transcripts, as the audience and the test-subjects learned more and more of the story, revealing secrets about certain test-subjects that should not have been uncovered by the test-subject retracing their steps.
